This project assesses the intraday and DA scenarios from the ORFEUS-GHS model run on the ERCOT TAMU testbed. We assess the stochastic scenarios for wind and solar assets over the 4 intra-day blocks $I_1,\ldots,I_4$ each of which includes 6 hourly datapoints and for the day ahead. Assessment metrics include PCA analysis, K-means clustering, Energy Scores, Coverage, PIT Histogram and Brier scores

PCA_Assets.m is a function that does the PCA analysis. The input is the asset in Array. PCA_AllAssets3.m calls all the assets for a date, and for each assets calls the matlab function PCA_Assets.m, This is for doing the PCA for the asset and save the first four PCA factors and first four explained series in csv format for all the assets and for 365 days in a folder named Coefficient. 

PCA_AnimationAssets.m is for calculating the Animation video for the PCA factors in a time range using the output csv files generated by the PCA analysis. It calls the function PCA_Animation.m

PCA_AggregatedAsset.m shows the PC1 of individual assets and PC1 of the aggregated sum of all the assets for the eight zones. The aggregated sum quite well matches with the individual assets' overall shape for both the cases (solar \& wind)

IllustrationDAID.m shows that DA and intraday scenarios and forecasts. Panels (a) 2017/03/02 and (b) 2017/12/12 are for the Fluvanna-I wind asset; Panel
