This project assesses the intraday and DA scenarios from the ORFEUS-GHS model run on the ERCOT TAMU testbed. We assess the stochastic scenarios for wind and solar assets over the 4 intra-day blocks $I_1,\ldots,I_4$ each of which includes 6 hourly datapoints and for the day ahead. Assessment metrics include PCA analysis, K-means clustering, Energy Scores, Coverage, PIT Histogram and Brier scores

PCA_Assets.m is a function that does the PCA analysis. The input is the asset in Array. PCA_AllAssets3.m calls all the assets for a date, and for each assets calls the matlab function PCA_Assets.m, This is for doing the PCA for the asset and save the first four PCA factors and first four explained series in csv format for all the assets and for 365 days in a folder named Coefficient. 

PCA_AnimationAssets.m is for calculating the Animation video for the PCA factors in a time range using the output csv files generated by the PCA analysis. It calls the function PCA_Animation.m
