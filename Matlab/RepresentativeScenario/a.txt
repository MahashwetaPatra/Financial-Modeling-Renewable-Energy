## Task: capture distribution of SCED generation costs using just \bred{50} rather than 1000 scenarios

Run InputFile.m file to get the K-S score values for all dates for all three algorithms. \item Naive baseline \bred{$k_1$}: random subsampling of scenarios. $k_2$: K-means directly on the 24-dim hourly scenarios of net load. $k_3$: PCA on the 24-dim net load scenarios, then K-means on the first four factor loadings.  The second alternative ($k_3$) works better. Assess subsampling performance using Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistic (lower is better) relative to the full cost distribution
